# 🔐 Identity & Access Management (IAM) Portfolio by Robert Coleman

Welcome to my professional IAM Portfolio. This repository highlights real-world labs and hands-on projects focused on Identity & Access Management using leading platforms such as **Okta**, **Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD)**, and **SailPoint IdentityNow**.

Each project is designed to reflect enterprise-level implementations of critical IAM components such as:
- 🔐 Single Sign-On (SSO) with SAML and OIDC
- 🛡️ Conditional Access Policy enforcement
- 🔄 Automated provisioning & deprovisioning workflows
- 📜 Policy-based access control and compliance tracking

These labs demonstrate my practical skills in building secure, scalable, and efficient identity systems across modern cloud-based environments.
